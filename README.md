1. Main features
— Allows you to enter your roommates.
— Allows you to enter products you bought and their cost.
— Allows you to select which roommates bought what via checkboxes.
— Displays a receipt with what every roommate bought and how much they’ll pay.
2. What does the program do and how to use it
— We made a program where the user can more easily split grocery costs with their
roommates.
— The program is separated into three different windows:
- The user will enter what products were bought and what they cost, as well as enter the
people that they will be splitting the cost with. The user is able to add/remove any amount of
products and roommates as they see fit.
* The user cannot proceed if they haven’t entered at least one product and at least one
roommate.
- When the user proceeds to the next window, they will be able to see the products they
entered and the roommates they entered laid out in rows and columns, respectively. The
roommates will have check buttons that the user will be able to select in order for that person to
pay for a certain product.
* If multiple roommates are selected for a single product, they will split that product evenly.
* If a single roommate is selected for a single product, that roommate will pay the full
amount.
* If no roommates are selected for a single product, the program will not let the user
proceed to the next window until at least one roommate is selected.
- Upon selecting and proceeding to the next window, the receipt is shown. The roommates
will be separated into different columns and below each roommate’s name, the products they
chose to split will be shown and so will their individual total cost. And then for reference, the total
cost of the groceries will be displayed below the roommate table.
3. How to run program
— You must download the 3 program files, making sure they’re stored within the same directory.
— Open GroceryAppFrame1.py and run the program from that file.
4. Who contributed to which parts of the program
— Window 1: Daniel Meiches
— Window 2: Alexia Kouletsis
— Window 3: Alexia Kouletsis
— README: Daniel Meiches
5. Limitations and Future Development
— The program was made with the intent of the user entering costs in euros, so in every window
the euro sign is displayed. For the future, we would develop an option for the user to select
which currency they want to use.
— You are only able to add and remove products, costs, and roommates. There is no option to
manually edit them. This could be a quality of life addition developed in the future.
— Visually, window 1 would be touched up in the future.
— In the future, we could make the program be able to save previous grocery lists, in case the
user wants to check back to a certain one or if they accidentally close out of the program.
